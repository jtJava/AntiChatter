# AntiChatter
Fixes keyboard chatter on Windows. Specifically made for a Drop CTRL, but should work for all mechanical keyboards.

To use this, complete the following steps:

1. Download the latest file from the [releases](https://github.com/jtJava/AntiChatter/releases) tab.
2. Press Windows key + R (or search "Run" in the search bar)
3. Type in "shell:startup" and press "OK"
4. Drag the file you downloaded in the folder that appears

That's it, the program will now run everytime you start your PC.
